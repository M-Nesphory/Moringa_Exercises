    "###  Introduction: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around **objects**—real-world or abstract entities that combine **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods). Instead of writing functions and variables separately, OOP bundles them into reusable, modular building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, OOP is about modeling the world with **classes** (blueprints) and **objects** (instances of those blueprints).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why OOP Matters in Python (and in Data Science!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm language, but it shines with OOP thanks to its clean syntax and flexibility. In data science and machine learning, OOP helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organize code into reusable components (like `DataLoader`, `Model`, `Evaluator`)\n",
    "* Build modular ML pipelines\n",
    "* Create custom objects that behave like native Python data types\n",
    "* Improve readability, scalability, and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Key Concepts of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore the four pillars of OOP, also known as the \"Big Four\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation** – Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object’s methods.\n",
    "2. **Abstraction** – Focusing on essential qualities rather than specific characteristics.\n",
    "3. **Inheritance** – Reusing code by creating a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism** – Using a unified interface to operate on different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 In this notebook, we’ll walk through these concepts step-by-step, using simple examples and gradually moving toward ML-friendly patterns.\n",

    "### Section 1: Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **everything is an object**—integers, strings, lists, functions, and even classes themselves! When writing object-oriented code, we define our own **custom objects** using *classes* as blueprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔨 Class vs Object\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class**: A blueprint or template that defines what an object will look like and how it will behave.\n",
    "* **Object**: An instance of a class—a concrete version of that blueprint, with real data.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Think of a class like a recipe, and an object as the actual dish you cook using that recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects allow us to bundle **data** (attributes) with **behavior** (methods) in a neat, modular way.\n",
    "This is powerful when structuring programs for things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data pipelines\n",
    "* Custom machine learning models\n",
    "* API wrappers\n",
    "* Game entities\n",
    "* and more...\n",
    "\n",
    "They help keep code organized, reusable, and easier to reason about.\n",

    "1. **Two Classes Defined**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Composition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Instead of just storing strings, the `Dog` class stores an **Owner object** inside the `owner` attribute.\n",
    "   * This allows `Dog` objects to use all the data and behavior of the `Owner` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Object Creation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `owner1` is an **Owner object**.\n",
    "   * `dog_2` is a **Dog object**, but its `owner` attribute points to the `owner1` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dot Notation for Access**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `dog_2.name` → gets the dog's name.\n",
    "   * `dog_2.owner.address` → follows the chain:\n",
    "     `dog_2` → `owner` attribute → `address` of that owner.\n",

    "###  Accessing and Modifying Attributes Directly\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can **directly access and modify attributes** on an object.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user1.email = \"hacked_email@fake.com\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While this works, in **real-world applications** (like an authentication system) this is **not ideal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You wouldn’t want users to freely change their details.\n",
    "* You also wouldn’t want them to sign up with invalid or weird emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because **direct attribute access gives no validation or control**.\n",
    "Imagine a user directly changing their password to `\"123\"` or their email to `\"notanemail\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Python Handles This\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides **two main approaches** to address this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traditional getters and setters**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Popular in languages like **Java**.\n",
    "   * You write explicit methods like `get_email()` and `set_email(new_email)`.\n",
    "   * Gives full control but can feel a bit verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Pythonic way: `@property` decorators**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Cleaner and more natural syntax.\n",
    "   * Lets you use attribute-like access (`user.email`) while still running validation logic under the hood.\n",
    "   * Also popular in **C#**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on “Private” Attributes in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some languages, Python does not enforce private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A leading underscore (e.g. `_email`) is a **convention** to mean *“this is for internal use — don’t touch it”*.\n",
    "* The philosophy is: **“We are all consenting adults here.”**\n",
    "* As developers, we *should not* access protected attributes directly, even though we technically can.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following examples, we’ll look at all three styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Direct access**\n",
    "* **Traditional getters and setters**\n",
    "* **Pythonic `@property` approach**\n",

    "\n",
    "When you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re just saying: *“When I create a new object, immediately attach a `name` attribute to it.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t “lock in” what attributes that object can have forever. In Python, instances are **dynamic dictionaries** under the hood (`obj.__dict__`). That means you can attach new attributes at any time, whether `__init__` defines them or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What happens when you do `p1.team = \"Chelsea\"`?\n",
    "\n",
    "This does **not** rewrite the constructor.\n",
    "It simply adds a new key-value pair to `p1.__dict__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p1.__dict__ = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "    \"team\": \"Chelsea\"   # <— new!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, `p2.__dict__` is still:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Rose\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the class `Player.__dict__` still has:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"team\": \"Ingwe FC\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So Python’s attribute lookup rules kick in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check `p1.__dict__` → finds `\"Chelsea\"`, done.\n",
    "2. Check `p2.__dict__` → no `\"team\"`, so fallback to `Player.team`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why it feels like `__init__` changed\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the *effect* of giving `p1` its own `team` is the same as if you had written:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, name, team=\"Ingwe FC\"):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.team = team\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "…**but only for that one instance** (`p1`).\n",
    "So your brain is spot on—it *feels* like the constructor was rewritten just for `p1`.\n",
    "But technically, it wasn’t; Python just allowed `p1` to grow its own new attribute dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why Python does this (and why it’s not a “flaw”)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is designed to be **flexible and dynamic**. Unlike Java or C++, it doesn’t force objects to have a rigid set of attributes. That’s why you can do this on the fly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "p1.new_stat = 99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and Python just shrugs and adds it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility is super powerful for things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prototyping quickly\n",
    "* Dynamic attributes (e.g., parsing JSON into objects)\n",
    "* Frameworks like Django/Flask where objects get attributes injected dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "But yes—it can also be confusing if you’re expecting strict, C++/Java-style OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__init__` is just a **convenience initializer**, not a strict schema.\n",
    "* Objects in Python are like **bags of attributes (dicts)** that you can add to anytime.\n",
    "* When you write `p1.team = \"Chelsea\"`, you’re **not editing the class or constructor**.\n",
    "  You’re just tossing `\"team\": \"Chelsea\"` into `p1.__dict__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why it feels weird—it’s not rewriting the function signature, it’s just dynamically giving `p1` its own version of `team`.\n",
